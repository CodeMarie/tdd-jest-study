## Questions

1. Explain what TDD is.

```
// TDD is test driven development, a cycle to help writing lean code to ensure tests are passed and only writing the code need to pass. 
```

2. List three benefits of TDD.

```
// Visual checks help to ensure good quality of code and simpler designs and to provide a platform for testing of code
```

3. Explain what is red, green, refactor.

```
// This is a colour scheme of code not working which is red, green code working and refactor as code to improve to make cleaner code.
```

4. What is "just enough code"?

```
// Using the first rule of TDD, there is only enough code typed which makes a failing test pass, this is the aim to reduce time in a debugger as an advantage. 
```
