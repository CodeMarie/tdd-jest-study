# TDD with Jest: Study

## Part 1 - Install & Try Jest

Step 1: Create a project folder call `jest-study` inside the root folder of the repository. So you get `tdd-with-jest-study/jest-study` folder.

Step 2: Launch a terminal/command prompt and change directory to the folder.

Step 3: Type `npm init` to create a `package.json` file

Step 4: Follow the steps in the [getting started](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) section. (use npm)

If you are stuck, look at the folder `tdd-with-jest-study/prepare-study` for example.
